When 15-year-old Emmylou arrives in Churchill, Manitoba, all she can think about is getting out of town before she ends up on the wrong end of a polar bear dinner. But things are rarely what they seem in the North and Emmylou's outlook begins to change -- fast. It all starts when she meets Barnabas, a young Inuk who is training sled dogs for the gruelling Arctic Quest. But her real Northern adventure begins when she falls for a spirited yet unruly puppy by the name of Qaqavii who turns her entire world upside down.",
