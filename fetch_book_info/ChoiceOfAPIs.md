### 1. **Open Library API (by the Internet Archive)**

- **API**: Open Library API

- Open Library has a vast catalog of books with a focus on editions. It supports retrieving multiple versions under a single work ID, which links various editions.

- **How It Works**: You can search by title, author, or ISBN. Each work entry aggregates all its editions, so you can retrieve all associated ISBNs, formats, and publication dates for a book.

- **Example Endpoint**: `https://openlibrary.org/works/{work_id}.json` – retrieves all editions for a work by its work ID.

### 2. **WorldCat API (by OCLC)**

- **API**: WorldCat Search API
- WorldCat is a global catalog of library collections. It tracks books, editions, and translations and links them by common metadata, making it ideal for finding multiple versions.
- **How It Works**: By searching with a title or ISBN, you can find various editions available in libraries worldwide, including specific formats and publishers.
- **Access**: Requires an OCLC developer key and is generally used in libraries and educational settings, but they offer a free trial for developers.

### 3. **ISBNdb API**

- **API**: ISBNdb API
- ISBNdb specializes in editions and versions for books identified by ISBNs, so it’s a great tool for finding all versions associated with a title.
- **How It Works**: You can search by title, author, or ISBN and retrieve details on multiple editions, including format (hardcover, paperback, e-book), publisher, and year of publication.
- **Access**: Requires an API key, and some advanced features are limited to paid plans.

### 4. **LibraryThing API**

- **API**: LibraryThing API
- LibraryThing offers data on books, including metadata like editions and different printings, and it allows users to catalog books in various formats.
- **How It Works**: Using its work and edition IDs, you can search for various versions linked to a title. It’s more community-driven but still comprehensive for edition details.
- **Access**: Requires an API key and a LibraryThing account.

### 5. **Google Books API (with Workarounds)**

- While the Google Books API doesn’t directly link editions, you can approximate version fetching with title searches or ISBNs for known versions. The Google Books API might return results with varying `publishedDate` and `publisher` fields for different versions, which can serve as a workaround to find alternate editions, but it’s not as reliable as other options listed.
